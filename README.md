# Virtual Assets Extension Specification

- **Title:** Virtual Assets
- **Identifier:** <https://stac-extensions.github.io/virtual-assets/v1.0.0/schema.json>
- **Field Name Prefix:** vrt
- **Scope:** Item, Collection
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/README.md#extension-maturity):** Proposal
- **Owner**: @emmanuelmathot

This document explains the Virtual Assets Extension to the
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (STAC) specification.

The **virtual assets** is an extension for STAC that allows a virtual STAC asset to be composed from other STAC [assets](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#asset-object) with repositioning, and algorithms potentially applied as well as various kinds of metadata altered or added.

- Examples:
  - [Item example](examples/item-sentinel2.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Item
  - [Collection example](examples/collection.json): Shows the basic usage of the extension in a STAC Collection
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/schema.json)
- [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

| key        | string | Identifier of the part in the virtuasl asset.

| href       | string | Relative and absolute URI pointing to the STAC item object using [JSON pointers](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6901). Each Uri **MUST** contain the [fragment component](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.html#section-3.5) to identify the object in the stac object. The fragment only preceded by `#` char identify an object of the current Item or Collection. ) |

The [fragment component](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.5) of the URI (after the `#`) is used
to identify the asset (or the band) composing the virtual asset.
URIs defined in the href arrays may reference several location according to the type of URI notation used.
Here are the accepted URI types and their location resolution

- `#/assets/B04` : Asset with key `B04` in the current STAC Item.
- `#/assets/data/bands/0` : Asset with key `data` and band index 0.
- `./item-sentinel2.json#/assets/B04` : Asset with key `B04` in the STAC Item with the relative URL `./item-sentinel2.json`.
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stac-extensions/raster/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json#/assets/B04` : Asset
with key `B04` in the STAC Item with the absolute URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stac-extensions/raster/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> the `bands` pointer under an asset would be valid only for STAC core version >= 1.1 but it can be interpreted as the band index
> in the asset for version < 1.1 or in the items where it is not present.

## Positioning

The positioning of the source assets is defined by their position in the `vrt:hrefs` array.

## Rescaling

A rescaling of the values from the source asset(s) to the destination asset can be defined using the `vrt:rescale` field.
It is specified as a 2 dimensions array of delimited Min,Max range per band.

```json
"vrt:rescale": [
  [0, 10000], // band 1
  [0, 10000], // band 2
  [0, 10000]  // band 3
]
```

A prescaling can also be performed according to the `offset` and `scale` fields value of the [raster](https://github.com/stac-extensions/raster) extension.

## Mandatory role

Every asset defined with `vrt:hrefs` field MUST declare the `"virtual"` asset role
in the [`roles` field](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/best-practices.md#asset-roles) array.

## Asset `href` link field

When it is possible, the href link field of the virtual asset should be set to a resource
that can be used to get the virtual asset (e.g. composition service).
When not possible, the href link field should be set to the self link.

## Use Cases

### Raster Composition

### Simple RGB raster composition

A very simple case would be the composition of a RGB natural color image of a
[Sentinel-2 item](https://github.com/stac-extensions/raster/blob/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json).

```json
"assets": {
  "trc": {
    "roles": [ "data", "virtual" ],
    "title": "Sentinel-2 Natural Color",
    "type": "image/tiff; application=geotiff",
    "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stac-extensions/virtual-assets/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json",
    "vrt:hrefs": [ 
      { "key": "red", "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stac-extensions/virtual-assets/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json#/assets/B04" },
      { "key": "green", "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stac-extensions/virtual-assets/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json#/assets/B03" },
      { "key": "blue", "href": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stac-extensions/virtual-assets/main/examples/item-sentinel2.json#/assets/B02" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Spectral index use case: NDVI

The following example describes a virtual asset `NDVI` with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index computed from 2 other bands.
The `vrt:algorithm` field is specifying an algorithm name to apply to generate the virtual asset : `band_arithmetic` that
process band pixels values according to the `expression` defined in the `vrt:algorithm_opts` object.
Data value is also rescaled in the range `[-1,1]` using the `vrt:rescale` field.

```json
"assets":{
  "ndvi": 
  {
    "roles": [ "virtual", "data", "index" ],
    "vrt:hrefs": [
      { "key": "B04", "href": "#/assets/B04"}, 
      { "key": "B05", "href": "#/assets/B05"}],
    "title": "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index",
    "vrt:algorithm": "band_arithmetic",
    "vrt:algorithm_opts": {
      "expression": "(B05â€“B04)/(B05+B04)"
    },
    "vrt:rescale": [[-1,1]]
  }
}
```

### File Archive

The [Collection example](examples/collection.json) describe an archive virtual asset composed of the 2 other assets of the collection.
An implementation for this collection could propose an additional download button that would package the assets in an archive
and return it to the user.

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
